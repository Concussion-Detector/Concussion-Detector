## About the Project
Our goal was to create an application which will roughly determine if an individual suffers with concussion.

The following objectives where identified to achieve our goals:

**Obtain Data** - Using a video from the camera, obtain player's pupil movement and extract x,y coordinates.

**Process Data** - Processing the captured data in order to create a graphical interpretation of x,y coordinates from both eyes.

**Compare Data** - Comparing both baseline and post concussion data. Once compared there should be a visible deviation in the pattern as the eye movement will be altered when player is concussed.

**Save Data** - Various data such as player's info, baseline and post concussion states are securely stored which allows to use each players data for further examination. 

**Report Findings** -  Provides a visual feedback of the results of the assessment.
